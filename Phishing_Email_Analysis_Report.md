Sender Address

Appears as support@paypa1.com instead of support@paypal.com.

Substitution of “l” with “1” is a classic spoofing trick.


Header Analysis

“Received From” server located in an IP range belonging to unknown hosting provider in Eastern Europe, not PayPal’s legitimate servers.

SPF/DKIM authentication failed when checked using an email header analyzer.



Links

Displayed link looks like PayPal.

Actual link: https://paypal.com.verify-user-login.secure-account-update.ru → redirects to malicious domain.

Mismatched URL is a major phishing red flag.



Language & Tone

Urgent and threatening wording:

“Verify immediately”

“Permanent suspension in 24 hours”

Creates panic to trick the recipient into clicking quickly.



Spelling/Grammar Errors

“Paypa1” in sender email.

Poor sentence structure: “To avoid suspension, please verify your account immediately by clicking the link below.”



Attachments

Account_Update.zip – suspicious compressed file, likely containing malware (e.g., trojan or ransomware).

Legitimate PayPal never sends .zip files for account verification.

Header inconsistencies and failed authentication checks.
