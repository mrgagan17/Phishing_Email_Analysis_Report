**Sender Address**

Appears as support@paypa1.com instead of support@paypal.com.

Substitution of “l” with “1” is a classic spoofing trick.


**Header Analysis**

“Received From” server located in an IP range belonging to unknown hosting provider in Eastern Europe, not PayPal’s legitimate servers.

SPF/DKIM authentication failed when checked using an email header analyzer.



**Links**

Displayed link looks like PayPal.

Actual link: https://paypal.com.verify-user-login.secure-account-update.ru → redirects to malicious domain.

Mismatched URL is a major phishing red flag.



**Language & Tone**

Urgent and threatening wording:

“Verify immediately”

“Permanent suspension in 24 hours”

Creates panic to trick the recipient into clicking quickly.



**Spelling/Grammar Errors**

“Paypa1” in sender email.

Poor sentence structure: “To avoid suspension, please verify your account immediately by clicking the link below.”



**Attachments**

Account_Update.zip – suspicious compressed file, likely containing malware (e.g., trojan or ransomware).

Legitimate PayPal never sends .zip files for account verification.



**Summary of Phishing Traits**

Spoofed sender domain (paypa1.com).

Header inconsistencies and failed authentication checks.

Malicious links with mismatched domains.

Urgent, fear-inducing language.

Spelling and grammar mistakes.

Suspicious .zip attachment.
